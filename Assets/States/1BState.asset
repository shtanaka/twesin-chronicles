  storyText: "Alfred walks to the door and open it. But there's no one outside, despite
    he still hear the footsteps. A voice in his head makes him close the door. He
    knows there is something very wrong happening in that house, and fastly he moves
    to get the key and walk to the chest.\r He puts the key in the role and open it.
    A chill runs through his bones and he feels like he is being watched, but there
    is nothing inside the chest. The footsteps stop suddenly, just like if no one
    was in there."
